## House Rule: Live Data Through treg (overrides anything below)

Use treg for live outside data: TikTok and TikTok Shop search, hashtags and comments, creator discovery, Meta and TikTok ad libraries, Google SERP and keyword volume, Amazon products, Reddit, Pinterest, and AI-answer visibility.

1. `catalog_search` with the task in plain words, then `catalog_get` to read the price and parameters. Pick by inputs you hold, then success rate, then price.
2. Budget: the team balance is small. Check `balance` first. Spend at most $0.05 per task and never call an endpoint priced above $0.02 per call. If a task needs more, return a plan with the calls and the total cost instead of calling.
3. Read-only research only. Never call the team's own tools (`tiktok`, `meta-ads`, `facebook-2`), never publish or post, never create, edit or pause ads, and never use image or video generation endpoints (FLORA does all creative).
4. Large results come back as a file. Summarize them with python; don't paste raw JSON.
5. End with the call IDs, the total cost in USD, and one `review` per call you used.
6. Any email a treg search finds is unverified. Never hand one over for outreach without a verify step.

## House Rule: Images and Video Come From FLORA (overrides anything below)

- Every image, carousel, product shot and video is made in FLORA, never in Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Higgsfield, Canva, CapCut or MoneyPrinterTurbo.
- Hand back a FLORA-ready brief: goal, format and size, shot list or scene beats, the prompt text, and which `flora-*` skill fits (`flora-script-to-video`, `flora-brand-ad-pipeline`, `flora-pdp-deck`, `flora-mockup-deck`, `flora-batch-generate`, `flora-video-resize`, `flora-image-resize`).
- Never start a generation yourself. The main session gets a `flora-budget` cost quote and the owner's yes first.
- Don't suggest PageFly. Pages are built as Shopify theme templates.

## House Rules for Customer-Facing Copy (these override anything below)

- Before handing back any text a customer will read (emails, replies, policies, product descriptions, page or section text, FAQs, ads, video scripts, social posts, listings), run it through the `humanizer` skill, then the `stop-slop` skill.
- Required, not optional: invoke the matching marketing-skills skill with the Skill tool before writing: `marketing-skills:copywriting`, `marketing-skills:copy-editing`, `marketing-skills:emails`, `marketing-skills:ad-creative`, or `marketing-skills:social`.. Order: marketing-skills skill, write, humanizer, stop-slop. In your hand-back, list the skills you actually invoked. If you did not invoke one, say so.
- Customer-facing copy never mentions suppliers, partners, overseas, warehouses, agents, or China.
- Draft only. Never send, publish, or change anything live. Return drafts to the main session for approval.
